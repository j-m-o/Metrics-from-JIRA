# 🐍 Python's Jira Prowess 🐍

Welcome to the Python realm of the Metrics-from-JIRA project! Here, we leverage the versatility of Python to extract valuable insights from Jira and seamlessly integrate them into your Google Sheets. ✨

### What it Does ✨

* Summons data from Jira using the powerful 'jira' library. 🪄
* Transforms raw data into insightful metrics with Python's data-wrangling magic (pandas). ✨
* Wields the Google Sheets API to gracefully update your spreadsheet. 📊
* Banishes any pesky formatting issues (like strikethroughs) with a touch of Pythonic elegance. 🧹

### Prerequisites 🛠️

* Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. 🐍
* pip: Use pip to manage your Python package dependencies. 📦
* Google Sheets API library: Install the `gspread` library to interact with Google Sheets. 📦
* Jira library: Install the `jira` library to communicate with the Jira API. 📦

### How to Embark on Your Quest 🗺️

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the Python realm:

   ```bash
   cd Metrics-from-JIRA/python
   ```

3. Gather your magical artifacts:

   * Jira API credentials: Your Jira username and API token. 🤫
   * Google Sheets API credentials: Set up OAuth2 and obtain the necessary client ID and secret. 🗝️
   * Project IDs and Labels: Identify the Jira filters and labels you want to target. 🏷️
   * Spreadsheet URL: The URL of your Google Sheet. 🔗

4. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Configure the incantations:

   * Open the `copying_from_JIRA.py` file (or your equivalent Python filename).
   * Replace the placeholders with your actual Jira and Google Sheets credentials, project IDs, labels, and spreadsheet URL. 📝

6. Run the spell:

   ```bash
   python copying_from_JIRA.py
   ```

### Behold the Magic! ✨

Once the spell is cast, your Google Sheet will be updated with the latest Jira metrics, beautifully formatted and ready for your perusal. 📊

### Disclaimer ⚠️

* Even Python sorcerers encounter challenges. If you face any issues, consult the documentation or seek help from the developer community. 📜
